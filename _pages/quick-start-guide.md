## Installation

WheelDash is available on the Garmin App store. Two "flavors" are available for WheelDash and WheelDash: datafield : a stable release and a development release (labeled "dev"). The development version includes the latest features but is also considered less stable, mainly because I sometimes push untested code (code related to a specific brand of wheel I don't own, features I can't test on my watch, etc.).

## Settings

WheelDash settings are accessible using Garmin Connect or Garmin Connect IQ Store.

## First connection

During the first connection, WheelDash captures the unique Bluetooth characteristics of your EUC to prevent accidental pairing with other EUCs from the same brand as yours.

### For the Garmin app version of WheelDash, please follow these steps :

1. Ensure you correctly set the wheel brand setting for the profile you intend to use.
2. Make sure that only your wheel is powered on around you.
3. Open WheelDash, select the profile you want to use, it will bring up the first connection screen.
4. Once you see a confirmation screen saying that your wheel is connected the app will take a footprint of your wheel to recognize it in the future, wait until the main screen of WheelDash is displayed. Exit WheelDash and power-off your wheel.
5. Power on your wheel again and restart WheelDash.
6. You can now start using WheelDash with your wheel!

### If you use the datafield version of WheelDash, please follow these steps :

1. Ensure you correctly set the wheel brand setting and the default profile to load accordingly to the profile you intend to use.
2. Make sure that only your wheel is powered on around you and that your smartphone (or any other device) is not paired to your wheel.
3. Open an activity and add WheelDash: datafield as a single custom field, switch to the WheelDash datafield view, it will bring up the first connection screen.
4. Once you see a confirmation screen saying that your wheel is connected the app will take a footprint of your wheel to recognize it in the future, wait until the main screen of WheelDash: datafield is displayed. Exit the activity and power-off your wheel.
5. Power on your wheel again and restart the activity containing WheelDash: datafield.
6. You can now start using WheelDash with your wheel!

## Let's ride

You can now start to use WheelDash!

If you use the Garmin app version and want to automatically record your riding session do not forget to enable "Automatic activity recording" toggle in Garmin Connect IQ app settings.

You can also manually start and stop the recording of your ride by accessing the activity recording view (by swiping up if you own a device with a tactile screen or by mapping a physical button to the action "activity recording view) and pressing the start/stop button.
