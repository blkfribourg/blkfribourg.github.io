Wheeldash: datafield now supports custom logo displayed as a background shape!

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/news/WD_DF_logo.jpg" alt="WheelDash: datafield background logo" %}{:.width-half}

The process to generate the input required for creating the logo is somewhat complex, and there are a few limitations.

If you are interested, please feel free to contact me!
