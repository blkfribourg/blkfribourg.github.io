I've developed a new application specifically designed for VESC-based PEVs: VESCDash. Please note that this app has only been tested with firmware version 6.02. Don't hesitate to reach out if your VESC is not currently supported. Due to limitations in Garmin's Bluetooth implementation, I have to specify the BLE advertising name for some VESCs to enable direct connection with the watch.
