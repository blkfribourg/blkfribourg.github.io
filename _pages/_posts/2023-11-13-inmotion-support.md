I began working on compatibility with InMotion wheels several weeks ago.

Unfortunately, I have observed that there seems to be an incompatibility between pre-v11 InMotion wheels (V5/V8/V10 and derived versions) and the Garmin BLE implementation.

Therefore, I am abandoning the development for the support of these models and focusing on supporting InMotion V11 to V14.
