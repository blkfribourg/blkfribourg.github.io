I can't find WheelDash on the Garmin Store or have an error saying the page doesn't exists.
{: .notice}

Please check that your device is compatible with BLE protocol and that your Garmin device is supported.

I can't connect to my wheel!
{: .notice}

Please ensure you've selected the right profile and that you properly configured the brand setting in WheelDash settings. If you owns a Kingsong please also try "Kingsong (old)" in Wheel Brand setting, especially if your EUC is pre-2021.

The battery percentage reported by WheelDash is different from other apps I use!
{: .notice}

In most cases, WheelDash consider a battery cell is empty at 3.2v, some app use different values, usually between 3.0 to 3.2v. You may find WheelDash is a bit pessimistic, but I'd rather like you to have a good suprise than a bad one.

Is there a manual for WheelDash?
{: .notice}

Yes, it's available here: <a href="/assets/pdf/WheelDash_Manual_v0.1.pdf">WheelDash manual</a>

My watch keeps disconnecting from my EUC while riding!
{: .notice}

Some users (exclusively Fenix 6 lineup owners) reported disconnection issue while riding. This issue lies on the hardware side and sadly there is nothing I can do about it.
Some users reported a downgrade of the Bluetooth software of their watch fixed the issue or significantly descreased disconnection event numbers.
